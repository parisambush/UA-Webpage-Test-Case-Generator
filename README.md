UA Webpage Test Case Generator

This is a Javascript app designed to generate Selenium IDE test cases for multiple versions of UA pages. This app is to be used to assist with automation testing of UA (User Agreement) pages for legal entities with multiple countires. This includes such entities as ROW (Rest of World), which has pages spanning over 146 countries.
