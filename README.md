UA Webpage Test Case Generator
========================

This is a Javascript app designed to replicate Selenium IDE test cases for multiple versions of UA pages. This app is to be used to assist with automation testing of UA (User Agreement) pages for legal entities with multiple countires. This includes such entities as ROW (Rest of World), which has pages spanning over 146 countries. Test cases created in Selenium IDE can be imported into the app, which will then generate test cases for all of the pages' English country versions. The code generated can then be inserted back into Selenium IDE and then run to start testing.

System Requirements:
